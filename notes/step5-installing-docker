# Step 5: Installing Docker!

The time has come at last. I have turned off my VM and turned it back on to let any package updates fully process.

In order to install Docker, I am going to need three tools

ca-certificates - to enable HTTPS downloads
curl - to download files from URLS
and gnupg to verify digital signatures. 

I attempted to install ca-certificates, curl, and gnupg to prepare for the Docker installation. 
The system confirmed these packages were already present and up-to-date. 
This verifies that the system is already capable of handling secure downloads and verifying digital signatures via GPG.

## making the download secure

I am going to be running a series of commands that, one by one, will ensure that my download is from a legitimate source

### First)
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

**purpose** With this, I am creating a directory at the Ubuntu standard location to store keys. I am also setting
permissions so that apt can read what is inside of my folder, and verify that the keys match. Here I am going to
directly save the key from Docker to ensure that everything I download is actually from them and not from a possibly malicious third party.


### second)
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
With this command, I am going to download their GPG key directly from their website at the given URL.
I will make the download -fail silently, -s not show a progress bar, -Show me an error if it fails, and -Location if it has changed, 
to automatically follow where it changed.

In the same command, I am also immediately passing the output from the command on the left
over to the command on the right with the | symbol

With the command on the right, with dearmor, I am taking the key from a human-readableformat, into binary, because that is what apt prefers.

And I am telling the system to store the key into the desired location

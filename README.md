# stardust-homelab
This repository documents my ongoing IT home lab project, built to strengthen my skills in system administration, virtualization, networking, secure configuration, and containerized workloads.  
It runs on an Ubuntu 24.04 ARM virtual machine inside Oracle VirtualBox on an Apple M2 system.

This lab is designed as a professional learning environment to support my growth toward IT support, cybersecurity, cloud fundamentals, and competitive early career programs such as the Lockheed Martin CWEP program.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Learn core virtualization concepts using Oracle VirtualBox  
- Install and configure a Linux VM (Ubuntu 24.04 ARM)  
- Build confidence with Linux administration (updates, packages, services)  
- Install and configure Docker on ARM  
- Deploy and manage containerized applications  
- Explore networking and secure configuration fundamentals  
- Practice structured troubleshooting and documentation  
- Build a professional, reproducible technical portfolio with GitHub

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
Building this home lab provides:

- Hands‑on experience with real IT tooling  
- Confidence working with Linux, networking, and containers  
- A strong documentation workflow using Markdown + screenshots  
- Demonstration of initiative, curiosity, and problem‑solving  
- A well-structured technical project for recruiters and technical interviews  
- Practical skills aligned with modern IT workflows and CWEP expectations

## 📅 Roadmap Phases
- **Phase 0:** Repository setup & project planning  
- **Phase 1:** VM creation & Ubuntu installation  
- **Phase 2:** First boot, system updates, health checks  
- **Phase 3:** Reinstallation to troubleshoot ARM/VirtualBox networking issues  
- **Phase 4:** Network testing & basic system hardening (UFW, system status)  
- **Phase 5:** Installing Docker (including troubleshooting ARM repo issues)  
- **Phase 6:** Docker fundamentals (running containers, logs, lifecycle)  
- **Phase 7:** Docker Compose introduction  
- **Phase 8:** SSH setup & remote administration  
- **Phase 9:** Git integration inside the VM  
- **Phase 10+:** User management, services, permissions, logging, scripting

## 📌 Current Status
**Phase 5 — Docker installation completed.**

Docker is successfully installed on Ubuntu ARM using the `docker.io` package after troubleshooting architecture‑specific repository issues.  
Preparing for **Phase 6: Docker fundamentals**, where the first real container will be deployed and managed.

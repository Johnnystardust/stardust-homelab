# stardust-homelab
This repository documents my ongoing IT home lab project, built to strengthen my skills in system administration, virtualization, networking, secure configuration, and containerized workloads.
This is built on an Ubuntu ARM virtual machine running inside VirtualBox on an Apple M2 system.
It is designed as a learning environment to support my growth toward roles like IT support, cybersecurity, and the Lockheed Martin CWEP program.

## Project Goals:
-Learn virtualization using Oracle VirtualBox
